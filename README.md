# Our goal is to create a platform that allow the search for services across the country and allow the provision of freelancer services. 

# Question: why not linkedIn?
-	This platform serves by location, thus locals can contact service provides for quick, easy service that otherwise needed manual look-up to get (for example, call water-mover service)

# Highlight features can potentially possess:
-	Summarized bio description for quick overview while searching for service provider. (Mantadory)
-	Secondary login functionality by face (Mantadory)
-	Average price estimation per service (Mantadory)
-	Online payment (Optional)
-	Notification system (Mantadory)
-	Chat system (Mantadory) 1


# Research on similar freelancing platform provider
they seem to include countries across the world. My guts tells me that would not work at least in Oman, the platform must include Arabic version of the platform and needs good advertising. There are some Omani platforms which are not well-known and uses manual linking between companies and service provides which is more specific case in comparison to the ultimate project goal.
